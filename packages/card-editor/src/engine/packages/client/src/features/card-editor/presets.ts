Rebalance field content across each card. Description = general identity and role. Personality = concise traits, temperament, and behavior patterns. Backstory = history, origin, and formative events. Appearance = physical detail. Scenario = default setting. Move content between fields to match these meanings while preserving every fact. A source field may legitimately be emptied; an empty newText is allowed only under this directive.`,
